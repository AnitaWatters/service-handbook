Welcome to the Digital Transformation Office's Service Handbook.

Here, we are writing our approach for building digital services that start with user needs, iterate quickly, and meet the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/).

We'll be adding more content to this guide over time. We welcome your suggestions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ausdto/service-handbook), or by tweeting us feedback at @AusDTO.
