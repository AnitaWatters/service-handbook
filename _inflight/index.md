Who is this for?
================

This handbook is for assessors using the [in-flight assessment process.](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/meeting-standard/#inflight)

If you are a member of a [digital delivery team](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-guides/the-team/) you might find this helpful too.

If you’re going to assess a service, or you’re building a service that will be assessed, you should start with the ‘How you’ll be assessed’ guidance for each [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/) criterion (there’s a page for each criterion).
