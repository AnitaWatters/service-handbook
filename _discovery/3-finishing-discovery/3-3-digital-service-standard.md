title: '3.3. Meeting the Digital Service Standard'
section: 3-finishing-discovery

At the end of Discovery your team should be confident that you meet the first few criteria of the Digital Service Standard.

The assessors assigned to your team will have been joining you for weekly check-ins, and maybe some of your other ceremonies.

## 3.3.1. Tracking progress against the Standard

The criteria pages that support the Standard, set out how teams will be assessed against the Standard at each stage of the design and delivery process. During Discovery teams should be focused on [criteria 1](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/1-user-needs/) and [criteria 2](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/2-multi-disciplinary-team/). 

A [KANBAN](https://www.dto.gov.au/files/digital-service-standard-kanban-a0.pdf) poster will help teams to track the activities and artefacts that help to demonstrate how the team is meeting the Standard as activities occur. 

Assessors will conduct Inflight assessment during the Discovery stage. They will start working through each criteria at the weekly check-ins, documenting progress on the RAG rating tool, introduced at Kick Off. 

This will also help the team to keep track of how they are meeting the Standard. When the service team and assessors agree that they have address criteria 1 and 2 adequately, and have been rated green, the service team can move to the Alpha stage of development. Sharing the RAG rating tool with your stakeholders is a good way to keep them informed of progress, and helps the team to identify any blockers.
