One or more prototypes are the key artefacts delivered as a result of Alpha. The prototype can range from a interactive HTML application through to a model office, depending on the problem/opportunity space

At the completion of [Discovery]({{site.baseurl}}/discovery), teams create a Discovery Deck, capturing the journey, findings and outcomes of Discovery.

Likewise, at the completion of Alpha, an Alpha Deck will be created, capturing:

 - An updated Service Map, reflecting “to-be”
 - Additional User Research insights about to user needs, building upon Discovery findings
 - Prototype evolution - validation of hypothesis, what has/hasn’t worked, demonstration of iteration in design based on usability testing
 - Outline of technology required during Beta to support the building of the MVP
 - Beta epics to support the building of the MVP
