Teams are encouraged to pick technologies which allow rapid validation of the hypothesis and can be responsive to changes in user needs.

Prototypes are achieved through code rather than prototyping tools, such as Axure, Omnigraffle, or Balsamiq.

Teams work with other members of their organisation to determine the technologies that will be supported, and if their organisation has any requirements for:


 - Development processes, such as peer-review
 - Integration requirements, such as security assessments
 - Deployment restrictions, such as private cloud
 - Operational restrictions, such as runbooks

Teams shouldnâ€™t try to perfect their prototypes. Instead they should be throw-aways that are used to test and validate ideas and learnings. If the team is planning go evolve a prototype through to Beta, hold off on productionising it until then.

Prototype integration is completed with upstream and downstream services, allowing teams to identify any integration issues that need to be catered for in Beta.

The prototypes are used as an opportunity to validate assumptions about how the technology meets the user needs, how it works, and how the team will implement capabilities such as continuous deployment and automated testing
