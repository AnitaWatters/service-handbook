At the completion of Alpha, teams will be assessed against the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/meeting-standard/). For reference, this is an [Example Assessment Report](https://www.dto.gov.au/projects/alpha-assemsment-department-immigration-and-border-protection-citizenship-appointment).

Note, teams are encouraged to self-assess against the DSS  throughout Alpha, ensuring no surprises during the formal assessment.
