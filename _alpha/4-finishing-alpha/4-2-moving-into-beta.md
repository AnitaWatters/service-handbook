title: 4.2. Moving into Beta
section: 4-finishing-alpha

Once you've defined your MVP, you can start to move towards starting your Beta service.

## 4.2.1. Choosing technology for the Beta

You will need to outline the technologies that will be used to build the Beta service. Choosing the right technologies for your team can be a difficult decision.

You should choose technology that supports:

- an agile and multi-disciplinary working environment, where everyone can collaborate around the code
- automated testing, continuous integration, and regular production releases
- [progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/progressive-enhancement.html), so that everyone can use the service
- being released as open source software, and ideally developed in the open

You should also consider the capabilities required in the team to support the technology choices, and the requirements to operate the service during the Beta and beyond.

## 4.2.2. Meeting the Digital Service Standard

You'll need to bring the service to an [assessment against the Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard). You won't be able to start Beta until the service gets a pass.

We recommend engaging early with the Digital Service Standard team to schedule the assessment. They will provide support and guidance to help you prepare.
