## What Alpha is

Alpha is the second stage of the service design and delivery process, where you test your hypothesis by building prototypes in code to explore different ways you might be able to meet your users' needs.

The purpose of Alpha is to validate if you are delivering the **Right Thing**:

 - It's an experimental phase, allowing you to test your hypotheses of how you might design a solution that will meet the user needs that were identified in Discovery
 - You use prototyping to validate ideas throughout
ensure the way you are designing the service is usable

An opportunity to validate you are delivering the **Thing Right**:

 - You validate the technical ecosystem, tech stack, and appropriateness for Beta and beyond, supporting agility and iteration
 - You form a cross-functional, multi-disciplinary team, working and behaving in an agile manner
 - An opportunity to explore a future vision (beyond the existing constraints)

## What Alpha is Not

 - Phase 1 of the beginning of Beta
 - Prototypes are not intended to be released publicly at the completion of Alpha
 - An opportunity to validate users likes/dislikes (instead, itâ€™s confirmation of whether the prototype achieve user needs)
 - Restricted to ONLY prototyping something that is constrained by current business, technical or time constraints - it can help explore a vision for the future, and validate if the effort to implement this over time would be worthwhile.
