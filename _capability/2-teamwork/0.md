title: "Teamwork level 0"
section: 2-teamwork
---

 - The project is segmented into different features/layers, which are exclusively owned by individual members of the team
 - The team has very low levels of coordination; breaking changes introduced to shared components without discussion / collaboration
 - Nobody knows how the entire system works, just how their component operates
 - The quality and 'feel' of the system differs widely based on the team member who developed it, often resulting in fractured user experiences and perceptions
 - When something breaks, the common response from the team is "that's not my problem", and the break is unresolved until the component owner fixes it
 - It is rare for new starters to join the development team, but when they do, they find it a very challenging environment.
