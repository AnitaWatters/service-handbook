## What is a capability model
Capability models are tools to help people develop by identifying opportunities, and guiding their progress to improvement.

The models describe high-level activities that contribute to the overall success of an initiative, and describe how the activities would be performed at different skill levels.

After identifying how well they're doing at a particular activity, people can look at how the activity is performed at a higher skill level, giving them direction and guidance about they can improve.


## Our model
We've developed this model based on what we've learned throughout our [transformation projects](https://www.dto.gov.au/projects), and our teams use it to improve their ability to deliver [simpler, clearer, faster public services](http://www.dto.gov.au).

It's important that you don't feel bad about what maturity level you are in the model - it's only purpose is to help you improve - so be honest.

Please don't use the model to criticise - it's based on our opinions and experiences, which aren't perfect.
